# Test DOCX Support

This is a test document to verify that DOCX support is working correctly.

## Features Tested:
- Text extraction from DOCX files
- Paragraph handling
- Special characters
- Multiple paragraphs

## Expected Results:
When you run the LDA analysis, this document should be processed along with other text files.

The system should now support:
- .txt files
- .md files  
- .docx files

This makes it easy to work with documents from Google Docs, Microsoft Word, and other sources.
