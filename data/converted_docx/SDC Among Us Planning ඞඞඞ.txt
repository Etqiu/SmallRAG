Procedure: 
	•	Explain to the kids the procedure. You kids are the crew of a spaceship, doing tasks to keep the ship going. For every task, you will get a token, this token you can exchange back at the sanctuary area to increase the task completion so that the crewmates can win. If you are an imposter, when you complete a task you can use your token to kill someone (by tapping them in the back lightly), and you can only do specific tasks and not the fun ones. The time limit of this game is 30 minutes. When you die you are a ghost and you should stay quiet because ghosts can’t talk, but you can still complete tasks and return them to the sanctuary.   To call a vote you can go press the button and exchange your only token to call a vote if you think you know who the imposter is. Remember, you only have one chance to call a vote. Once the vote is called you must drop everything you are doing, no kills can be made while walking there, the game is essentially paused.   When you die you must show that you are a ghost by showing your paper that obviously has a ghost on it. You must also place the dead body thing on the ground to signify that you are dead. Other people can report this dead body, by calling a counselor. The vote will be immediately called, and imposters can report their own dead bodies.

	•	Make the kids put their heads down. Tell them if they’re tapped on the shoulder then they are assigned impostors and can pick their heads up. Tap three kids very firmly on the shoulder. Say “You three are the impostors, remember each other. Don’t make a sound and put your heads back down.”
	•	Tell everyone to pick their heads up now. Pass out task sheets to every kid, including the impostors. Say “Okay crewmates, time to do your tasks. There are three impostors among us” Start the timer
	•	Each counselor is assigned a room and the associated games to monitor. They are to explain the tasks if they need explaining and pass out tokens to kids who finish a task and then reset the task for the next person. There should only be 2 tasks per room at most. Each counselor gets a walkie talkie which they can let kids use to report a body and call a meeting. The counselors can join in the meetings if they want.
