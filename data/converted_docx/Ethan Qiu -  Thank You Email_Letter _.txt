Dear Ms. Rain, 

Thank you very much for your time for the interview. I had a great time speaking with you about the PC JRELL role. From the interview yesterday, I believe that being in JRELL will really be a great opportunity for me.

I really had a lot of fun talking about your need for someone who can add value and knowledge to new participants.  It's a great idea, and I've been thinking about it since our conversation. Since our meeting, I have been very excited about thinking about the projects offered at the PC JRELL position because of my past experiences in being able to coordinate groups and ideas well. I believe that the JRELL position will be really exciting as well as a good fit for me as well. 

I believe that being able to speak both Mandarin and Chinese, as well as being able to speak up with participants will really give JRELL a great counselor to help participants. Iâ€™m excited to give these skills to JRELL for the better of the future of new participants. If you need any extra information, please feel free to contact me by email or phone.

Sincerely,
Ethan Qiu
