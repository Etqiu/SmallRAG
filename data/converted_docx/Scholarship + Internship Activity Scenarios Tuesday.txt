Breakout 1: Amanda
Amanda is 15 and a rising junior in high school looking for a scholarship and internship to apply to. She knows that she is interested in medicine, but she doesn’t exactly want to become a doctor or nurse. She excels in science and history and is the team captain for the varsity team at her school. In the past, she used to walk dogs for some spending allowance and also like to help her parents with growing organic fruits and vegetables in their backyard. She plans to take some hard classes this upcoming school year and doesn’t want to spend more than 20 hours a week working. She is described by her teachers as very quiet, but very good at coming up with creative ideas to solve problems.
