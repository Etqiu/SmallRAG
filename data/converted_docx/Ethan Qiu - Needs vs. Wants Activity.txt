Part 2 below








Now that you’ve filled out the table, let’s reflect: Use complete sentences! (3 sentences minimum per question) 

	•	What do you notice about your general spending habits and priorities?
I tend to spend more on needs, things I need to survive. I usually tend to spend some on trends and high wants, but I spend the least on wants. Even though it feels like I really want something, I usually tend to spend more on the needs since it is needed for surviving. 


	•	If there was something you could improve about your spending habits, what would it be?
I would want to spend less on some things, like a pretty expensive hoodie or an expensive water bottle. Also spending a little more on needs than the expensive wants could be a change too. Just spending more on needs seems to be in my list of improvements.

The 50 30 20 rule. It states that 50% of your income should be going for must haves, like toilet paper or water. 30% should be going for nice to haves, and 20% should go into saving.
