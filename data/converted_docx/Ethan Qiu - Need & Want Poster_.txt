Here are some questions you can reflect on:
- Why do you need certain things?
- Why do you want certain things? 
- How are you planning to get what you want?

You need certain things, such as toilet paper, because without those things, you could not survive with good hygiene and health. You want certain things such as a phone, watch or expensive shirt because it looks good with you, or gives you enjoyment in using them. I am planning to get what I want with first spending on needs, then seeing what I have left to spend on wants. On my poster, it shows that you need housing, electricity, food, water, and a source of income. For the wants side, I put the things that you donâ€™t especially need, such as a phone or laptop.
