Hello, Fall 2023 Elections Committee! Here are the instructions and documents for ballot typing:

9/24 Agenda: Ballot Typing
We will fill out only columns B, C, and F today. You’ll be repeating the process below for each applicant you have. My suggestion is to go one applicant at a time instead of checking all applicants’ attendance/activities at once.

First, please type the names of the applicants you’ve been assigned in column B. Reference column G for your respective cells. Make sure there are enough cells for the ballots you’ve been assigned—you can add more if you need to.

Attendance:
	•	Open the F'23 Prospective Members Meeting Attendance (Responses)and F'23 Faculty Ballot 
	•	Confirm that your applicant has attended one of the prospective member meetings. 
(Pro tip: CTRL + F to find names quickly.)
	•	If they are not listed in the attendance spreadsheet, check this sheet: F'23 External Attendace Prospective Members Meetings. If you still cannot find their name, let me know.
	•	If they filled out the attendance form, please proceed to write the applicant’s first and last name and registry in your highlighted section on the Faculty Ballot spreadsheet. Include their preferred name (if they have one) by listing it in parentheses. 
	•	Move on to the next step.

General Information and Activities on the Faculty Ballot:
	•	Check if the student said “Yes” or “No” in the “Have you been suspended?” column. If they marked “yes,” Highlight the entire row in red before listing to activities. If not,  move on to the next step.
	•	Briefly view signatures.
	•	Please ensure there is a signature for each activity listed. If you notice discrepancies or suspect signature forgery, please let me know.
	•	If an activity is reported in a category that does not seem appropriate, please let me know.
	•	For CSF and Peer Mentoring, please ensure that a signature is from one of the following:
	•	Peer Mentoring: a signature from Flores or any project leader will do.
	•	CSF: a signature from Flores or any officer will do.
	•	If the signature section is blank, please let me know.
	•	Consolidate their activity information into the Activities column. 
	•	Convert appropriate activity names into their acronyms using the club acronym sheet if needed. 
	•	F'23 Club Acronym Key
	•	When listing an award, you would just write 1x.
	•	When listing all of the activities, make sure that separate activities are separated by commas, but do not separate the activity name, the number of semesters, and hours per week by commas. You will copy their time commitment exactly as they have written it on their application.
	•	EX: Reg .Representative 4x 2 hrs per week, Varsity Baseball 2x 6 hrs per week
	•	See example below
	•	If there is a lack of a signature of something to the degree of “external verification”, let me know and also approved people linked below:

Preview for Next Week:

Fall 2023 Prospective Members Transcripts		

	•	Please search through the folder listed above and ensure that all of your applicants have submitted a copy of their most recent transcript.
	•	If they have not, please let me know.


9/27 Agenda: GPA Calculations
 Transcripts
	•	Open the shared folder titled: F'23 Transcripts 
	•	Find your applicant’s transcript. (Pro tip: CTRL + F to find names quickly.)
	•	Use the GPA Recalculationssheet to recalculate each applicant’s GPA 
	•	Make a copy of the sheet so you do not get in the way of your peers! 
	•	Calculate their ratio of Honors/AP courses over the total amount of courses they have taken for their freshman and sophomore years. (Please read everything below before you start calculating.)
	•	Remember each course is calculated by semester.
	•	EX: Semester-long classes like AP Human Geography count as 1. Year-long classes like AP World History count as 2.
	•	Do NOT simplify the fraction.
	•	Do not include College and Career in your calculations (shows up in 2nd semester freshman year). Do not include PE IS (Independent Study) because JROTC will be counted. Count summer classes ONLY if they’re on the transcript (ex: Geometry, Health). If an applicant has somehow attached their transcript for community college courses from this past summer, do not count it. Just let me know.
	•	Don’t forget to count honors courses too!
	•	Copy and paste columns D & E from the F'23 Faculty Ballot  to columns B & C on the F'23 Student Ballot
	•	Review that ALL information is accurately listed on the ballots.
