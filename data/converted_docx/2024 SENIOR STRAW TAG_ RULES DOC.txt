GAME INSTRUCTIONS:
You are an assassin and are given a boba straw with your assigned target on an attached paper. This is the person you must track down and tag. By participating you are consenting to be filmed on camera.

To tag your assignment, touch them with the boba straw that has their name on it. You must record them getting tagged. However, if your target is performing the action described under the T.O column, they are safe and protected from being tagged. 

Once you tag your target, they must hand you their straw. Be sure to confirm the tag via Google Form below ASAP! Any form submissions past Friday’s of the week will be counted as late and you will be eliminated even though you may have tagged your person before Friday. The next person you must track down and tag will be your former target’s assignment. For example: Person X is assigned to Person Y, and Person Y is assigned to Person Z. If X tags Y, then X’s next target is Z. Y is eliminated. 

To move on to the next week’s round, you MUST complete at least one elimination during the current round. If you fail to do so, you are eliminated. After you complete one elimination, you have the option to tag your target’s assigned person to speed up the game. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor! 

Grievances can be sent to the senior board account on Instagram (@lowell2024board). Please note that if you report someone for breaking rules or cheating, you must provide evidence to back up your claims.

NOTE: You MUST tag 2 people this final round. 

Prize: One free prom ticket!!

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
Game Hours: Start of 8:40 am - 5pm. Any location is valid for tagging, so long as it does not violate the rules below. This includes on/off-campus, Stonestown, the 29 Bus Stop, etc.

There can not be any eliminations made in the duration of a class, as long as your target is in-class learning. However, if you get up to use the restroom, or are dismissed from class early, you can be tagged. . You cannot tag people during their extracurriculars, this means club meetings, sports practices, rehearsals etc. 

For Week 2: You may NOT tag others during spirit week games OR during the rally. Your tag will be considered INVALID and you must retag them again.

RULES:
	•	No tagging during class. Passing period tags are acceptable, as well as tags within a classroom as long as the class is not in session. 
	•	You cannot tag during reg.
	•	You must record your target
	•	No forcefully taking boba straws away. 
	•	No tape/glue/string/adhesives that attach the straw to your hand. The straw must be within your hand without external assistance. 
	•	Do not tamper with the straws. You may repair the assigned name tag, but you cannot cover the name.
	•	If you lose your boba straw, you are automatically disqualified. Please let us know immediately. If the person you are assigned to tag has lost their boba straw, let us know as soon as possible. 
	•	DECOY/FAKE STRAWS ARE NOT ALLOWED. The only valid straws are the ones participants are given. Anyone caught with a decoy/fake straw will be disqualified.
	•	You MUST pick up your straw on the straw pick-up date. If you fail to do so, you are automatically disqualified, and the person with your name on their straw automatically moves on. NO EXCEPTIONS.
	•	If you are tagged you must give your straw to the person who tags you. If there is a discrepancy, let us know as soon as possible via the contacts above. 
	•	When you are tagging, you must have your straw in your hand. 
	•	Please be respectful of classes when tagging, and do not be disruptive. This game is a privilege. 
	•	DO NOT trade your straw(s). Your string of boba straw assignments is UNIQUE TO YOU. You will be disqualified and will have effectively killed the game. 
	•	You may not tag inside any classrooms while class is in session and you may not disrupt classes. Failure to do so will result in disqualification.
	•	Even if you’re in a classroom and the passing period has not ended, you are still vulnerable without a straw in your hand. The “no tagging during class” does not count unless you are in a class during class time. (e.g. you can get tagged in the library, during your free block, on your way to Stonestown, etc.) 
	•	You cannot show up to your target’s house and/or property. 
	•	No tagging people in the locker rooms
	•	No running when tagging in the library
