Walkie Talkie. Important station! Direct runners to take the left path going into the Rolling Hills. Prevent runners from racing onto the right path which is a flater gravel road (which Andy calls the emergency lane). Spectators can be directed to form a human barrier to assist you. Be assertive! Be especially alert during the morning races. Once people learn the course, this job gets easier as the day progresses.
