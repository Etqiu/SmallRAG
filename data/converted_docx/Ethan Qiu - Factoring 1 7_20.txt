Factoring 1 7/20

Factor the following expressions:
1) x2 - 6x - 27				2) x2 + 11x + 18			3) x2 + 5x - 24





4) x2 - 10x + 21			5) -x2 - 10x - 9				6) 2x2 - 4x - 20





7) Write the polynomial modeled then factor.
a) 					b) 


7) Find all possible values if b so that x2 + bx + 6 can be factored into binomial factors.





8) The area of a rectangular fountain is (x2 + 12x + 20) ft2. The width is (x + 2) ft.
	•	Find the length of the fountain.




	•	A 2-foot walkway is built around the fountain. Find the dimensions of the outside border of the walkway.




	•	Find the total area covered by the fountain and walkway.
