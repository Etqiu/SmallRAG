“Kilo Yankee Lima Echo, Number Six on the Approach, Cleared ILS Runway Seven Left Approach”

Dear ERAU admissions staff,

Working in commercial aviation has been my dream ever since kindergarten. One worksheet we were given had but a single question: “What do you want to be when you grow up”. Even with several lines of space, I eagerly wrote my sole dream profession at the time: “Flight Attendant”. However, as I began middle school, I realized that I didn’t want to simply be confined to one plane, I wanted the ability to see and enjoy them all. That’s when I discovered Air Traffic Control, and I was immediately hooked. While other passions have come and gone, my dreams of being in the tower and working with various aircraft have only deepened. That conviction has only been reinforced by the insurmountable challenges I’ve faced when delving into the complex field alone. 

ATC games like OpenScope were fun, but only provided a limited radar environment simulation devoid of human interaction. I believed that VATSIM would be the platform which realized my dream as I awaited the real thing, but the overwhelming breadth of knowledge drowned my motivation and confidence. Even after persevering for over a year to get certified, I came to feel alienated from the community I’d worked so hard to join. My passion, however, never died, so I kept trying. I joined the IVAO, PTFS, and Aeronautica communities, but none provided the professionalism and activity for which I longed.

I finally found my match at FlightLine, where I met Scot, an instructor and the most influential person in my ATC “career”, who helped me every step of the way despite being 12 hours apart on the other side of the world. Having someone I could always reach out to made me realize how important networking is, and while he’s not as familiar with FAA procedures nor is he a professional, he continued to work with me through every question and curiosity I had even beyond my promotion to ATC Instructor. Having just a single friend allowed me to dedicate myself to that community, to create new training materials, create new exams, refine procedures, host live (virtual) trainings, and most fundamentally, to be open and kind to anyone courageous enough to simply speak up. In hindsight, struggling through VATSIM paid off more than I could’ve expected. It was that struggle which made transitioning to FlightLine so much easier and which made me valuable as an instructor. 

Through any adversity, social, academic, or domestic, my goal to be ATC has never wavered, and that’s why I’m certain I want to attend Embry Riddle to major in Air Traffic Management. As an accredited AT-CTI school and an institution renowned nation-wide for its aviation programs, Embry embodies the best opportunity for me to hone my ATC knowledge and succeed in the profession. It’s an expensive investment, but ATC is my passion, and I will not jeopardize it by seeking anything but the best. 

I believe that my strong dedication and drive for success make me a perfect fit for Embry. I am a quick and adaptable learner who loves to help others, whether classmates or professors, having TA’d in my freshman and junior years after school or during lunch and officially in my senior year. I am someone who gives his best effort towards any task no matter what it may be. In eighth grade, when our band director suddenly disappeared, I took initiative, leading and conducting the band when we had no substitute despite a majority of the band’s lack of motivation. The band had successful concerts, and at the winter concert, I was granted the honor of conducting. The culmination of my experiences from conducting and leading a club to being an ATC Manager have all fostered my leadership skills immensely, but the most valuable trait I gained was empathy. No matter how apt one’s managerial skills are, they can’t be a valuable team member if they don’t take the time to understand and support others. As soon as Scot opened the door to the FlightLine community for me, I understood the vitality of being there to open that door for others interested in ATC so they don’t have walk alone as I once did. Now, Embry Riddle is my gateway to the final ascent to my dreams as an Air Traffic Controller.

- I was the sole freshman in my high school’s varsity boy’s volleyball team in 2020. However, the pandemic cut our season short and canceled the entire 2021 season. I returned for the 2022 season as libero, and our team won the CIF San Francisco Section championships and reached 2nd place for the NorCal Regional tournament, with the CIF listing me as an honorable mention. 

- In pursuing my passions for Air Traffic Control, I’ve become an ATC Manager for the Official FlightLine Community, where I create and administer new exams, self-study materials, and training videos. I’ve also studied rigorously towards more professional networks like VATSIM, where I’ve earned my S2 rating with the ZLA ARTCC, and IVAO, where I’ve attained my AS3 rating in the XA (North America) division and had the opportunity to be ZLA Assistant Chief, but was unable to do so due to miscommunications between the instructors. 

- I founded the Lowell Cancer Awareness Club with several other students in 2020 (sophomore year). I am currently the acting vice president and am responsible for leading bi-weekly presentations on cancer-related subjects, creating informative slideshows and activities, and organizing inter-club relations.

- Other clubs that I’m participating in include Shield and Scroll, a selective honor and service society that volunteers around school and staffs school events; CSF (the California Scholarship Federation), a club which provides tutoring to other students; ARK (Acts of Random Kindness), which does monthly “acts” around the school to brighten up peoples’ days; and Heart in Motion, a volunteer organization mainly serving at local marathons.

- I’m also very involved in volunteering around the city. I currently volunteer with the SFO Travelers Information Program, where we operate the information desks at the (K)SFO airport. I’ve also volunteered in the Teen Tech Corps at the SFPL (San Francisco Public Library) Ortega Branch, which assists drop-in guests with any technology-related inquiries.

- I’ve taken part in internships offered by the city as part of the OFA (Opportunities for All) and MYEEP (Mayoral Youth Employment & Education Program) programs. In OFA, I was part of the Food Security cohort which studied the impacts of food insecurity and created a newspaper using that knowledge. In MYEEP, I learned communication skills and professionalism. MYEEP also provided an intern position at World Stars, where I helped research and reach out to Korean-American professionals in the Bay Area for recruitment and helped teach a client how to operate Zoom and Google Classroom.

- I was employed at Uncle Tetsu, a Japanese Cheesecake store, until a new manager took me off the shift schedule without notice, working as a cashier and baker’s assistant. My responsibilities include operating the ovens to bake cheesecakes and cheese tarts, serving guests, packaging cheesecakes, cashiering, distributing samples, and washing dishes.
