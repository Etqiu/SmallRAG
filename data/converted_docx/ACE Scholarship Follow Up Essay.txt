	During this upcoming school year, I have the privilege of attending California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo as an architecture major. This five-year accredited program, and the school as a whole, are known for the practical motto, “Learn by Doing,” which strives to express focus on learning practical and applicable skills. This is further demonstrated through their abundant resources, like the materials laboratory, individual project desks, and multiple fabrication labs, all of which I will make great use of. Thus, my goal of becoming a licensed and practicing architect is well supported by the curriculum and resources provided to me, and I will be prepared to enter the workforce just after graduation. 

One of my long-standing goals is to travel abroad to learn about other cultures. In addition to their on-campus resources, Cal Poly offers a wide variety of study abroad programs, including several that are specific to architecture majors and experiences, which would help me achieve just that. These programs are offered in several countries I am interested in learning about such as Japan, Germany, and Italy. If time allows, I aim to participate in at least one of these programs and become more aware of that culture’s significance in architecture, as well as its architectural style. Using this knowledge I will incorporate these principles into my designs as a practicing architect, to help people from all backgrounds and cultures feel welcomed and at home! 

I am incredibly excited to begin my journey in architecture, especially because of all the amazing opportunities and resources this school offers, and I am so grateful to ACE for making this opportunity more accessible to me.
