Why Harvard, what do you want to study and WHY?

When I was a 7th grader, I was brought to an informal brown-bag meeting with my dad at the federal reserve who works as IT support for the Bank president Mary Daly. I saw economists talk about the world and domestic economy, investment options, and their potential retirement. 

	•	Some economists that worked at the Federal Reserve were alumni of Harvard
	•	I founded an Investment Club because I saw an opportunity to have these “brown bag” meeting
	•	 Later I saw Harvard as a way to expand my education and also follow the footsteps of the great, who i admired, my father’s co-workers.

Challenge or leadership-   Talk about getting a sponsor for investment club.
We started talk about options trading “brown-bag” which I thought it was too much, so I lead an paper trading simulator so we could discuss other forms of investment before getting into options.
