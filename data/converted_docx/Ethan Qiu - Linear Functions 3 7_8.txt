Linear Functions 3 7/8

Directions: Write an equation for the line that is perpendicular to the given line and that passes through the given point
1) y = -3x + 4; (6, -2)			2) y = x - 6; (-1, 2)			3) 3x -y = 8; (-6, 5)





4) Write an equation describing the line that is parallel to the y-axis and that is 6 units to the right of the y-axis.





5) Graph y = x + 2 and y’ = 2x + 2. Then describe the transformation from the graph of y to the graph of y’.





6) Graph y = x and y = - l x - 3 l + 2 and describe the transformation.






7) Which 2 lines are parallel?
	•	y = 1/3x 
	•	y = 3x +2
	•	y = -1/3x -6
	•	y = 3x
