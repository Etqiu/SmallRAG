Good intensity especially with the slow section and great work so far. Keep the tempo steady even when you add rubato and lift pedal slowly at each rest. Pedal missing in ms 9-10? In the last slow section, Grave, count all rests and be ok with the bigger amount of silence! That’s what makes it so intense.
