Tips
	•	Please refer to the videos from this week’s assignment #1 if you need reminders 
	•	Prepping answers for questions that the interviewer may ask about you and the position can help you feel more confident during the interview
Research about the Company: 
Doing your research on a company before going to an interview provides some important benefits that can put you ahead of the competition. Such as understanding the company and their culture, help you answer some common interview questions, and know what skills and personality traits the employer is looking for. It also allows you to learn if the company matches with what you are looking for (salary, benefits, working environment, etc..)!

So, before you start the common interview questions section, please answer the following questions first: 
	•	Name of the company 
CYC SF JRELL

	•	List three interesting facts about that company
They help people improve public speaking with zoom meetings.
Also like MYEEP, JREEL hosts training for workers and workshops for participants.
Another fun fact about JRELL is that they help non-English speakers become better at English with these workshops.


	•	What is the job description for the position that you are applying for?
Title: Peer Counselor (PC)
Reports to: JRELL Program Coordinator
Common Interview Questions: 
	•	Tell me about yourself.
Hello, I am Ethan and I am an upcoming sophomore at Lowell High School. I like playing the piano as well as playing chess. In the next school semester, I will be taking AP Chinese and as well as taking my next piano exams.

	•	Why did you want to apply for this position?
I wanted to apply for this position because it fit my role perfectly. I can both speak English as well as Chinese fluently and I can also work with others and in groups well too. Applying to this position will give me more work experience and more team experience as well. 

	•	What are your goals?
I believe that becoming better at speaking Chinese and being better at my English as well can be two goals I have for this job. I also want to be the best peer counselor I can for JRELL. This means trying my best to improve my Chinese and English for this job as a commitment.

	•	What can you offer to the position?
I am a team player with a can-do attitude. I have been working with MYEEP and have been able to work with groups online pretty well. I have experience with speaking Mandarin and English as I have taken Chinese 3 as well as translating Mandarin to English to some of my grandparents who don’t speak Mandarin. I can also offer my technology skills with being able to fix errors on zoom, online editing, and photo editing. 

	•	What is your work style?
I can work independently while also being a great team member. I won’t be a downfall of a team, but instead, I am usually the one who tries to uplift and support the team. I can say from my past work experiences, I work with a group really well, as well as being able to hold myself independently 

	•	What is/are your greatest strength(s)?
I believe that my greatest strength is that I can complete many things on time and correctly. An example of this is when I have been given a lot of homework and when I also have had MYEEP as well. I created a schedule to help me complete both subjects at the same time so I could have extra time to even practice piano for an hour.

	•	What is/are your greatest weakness(es)?
My greatest weakness right now would be that I sometimes focus too much on a single part of a project, and might lose track of the schedule I usually plan. I’ve improved in this by checking what parts I am at and what time it usually is. This way I can still give the best I can to the project, while also being organized on time.
How do you handle stress and pressure? What is/are your approach(es)? 
I usually handle stress and pressure by usually trying more on many assignments and giving it my all during this stress. For example, I once had four large tests in one week and had only a few days left to study. I gave it my best, with creating a schedule for studying sessions, sometimes going overtime. I managed to complete all tests with A’s and avoided overthinking about it.

	•	What is/are some of your past experience(s) related to this job position and how will it help you succeed? If not, what skills can you offer?
Some past experience I have had is with a summer camp called SDC. I helped plan activities as well as helping kids speak up and make new friends. I put dedication into helping plan these activities by thinking about what the kids interests were as well as helping lead these activities out with my co-workers.
Periences I can over, 
	•	Do you have any last questions for us regarding this position, or was there anything you wanted to add that we may have missed during the interview?
What is the daily task I would be expected to do when I first start my job? What does the working environment look like? What kind of training do you provide?
