Part 1:

Answer the following questions below in complete sentences: (3 sentences minimum)

	•	What are your personality types and leadership styles? 
Protagonist is my personality type. My leadership style is Democratic Participative Leadership and Delegating Leader. I think that this test matches pretty fairly on how I see what leadership is and what I usually do whenever I lead a group. 
	•	What are some of your strengths and weaknesses?
I believe some strengths I have are that I can handle a large amount of things to do as well as being able to easily focus on a new topic or idea. For example, I am able to complete many assignments in Lowell while having to balance out other clubs or extracurriculars. An example of a weakness I have is that I sometimes am a little shy or don’t really want to join a group that I have no connection with.  

Part 2:

Below are some scenarios. As a leader, you have to think about how you would approach these scenarios, consider your values, strengths, weaknesses, and leadership style in your answer. 

	•	How would you approach a situation where a participant privately messages you about feeling uncomfortable about something that was said in the workshop? (3 sentences minimum)
I would approach this by first responding to the message to make sure that I was active in the chat. Then I would try to contact my manager/host to see what was wrong and how we could fix it. Then I would try to find the uncomfortable “thing” in any of our upcoming presentations or projects and try to diminish that. 
	•	You see that there is tension between 2 of your teammates. Everyone else in the group has noticed, how would you handle this scenario? (3 sentences minimum)
I would first try to privately talk to each group member. Then I would try to find out what has happened to these 2 group members and why they are acting so tense. Then after this I would try to find a solution to make sure this tension doesn’t increase or becomes worse.
	•	 You're in a breakout room with your groupmates but realize that the same voices are speaking up. How will you ensure every voice is heard?  (3 sentences minimum) 
We ensure that every voice is heard by first trying to say, “How about you ___Name___?” Then if they don’t speak up I would have to try to contact them with a private message or speaking up to say that it's okay to type in the chat. Then after that, if they don’t do any of those, I would call in the host of the meeting or my higher up to see if they could hear or see us.
