Instructions: You have received $500,000 dollars to start a business! A group of potential sponsors will be meeting with you within the next few days to discuss what your business pitch will be. You must brainstorm an original business idea and write 2 paragraphs (5+ sentences each paragraph) answering but not limited to the following questions:
•  What is your business about?
•  What does your business strive to achieve?
•  What kind of funding would this business need?
•  What kind of people should be involved with the process of this business?
•  How would your business make a profit?
•  Why should the potential sponsors fund your business?
Feel free to be as creative as possible with your business idea, even if it is impossible to exist right now. If needed, feel free to include images, videos, articles, etc. to help support your pitch. Make sure that your reasonings are logical and also answer all the questions listed.

My business will be a restaurant business that mainly serves Chinese food to customers. I believe that my business will strive to achieve excellence in food and quality. Not only that, but we will be as authentic to Chinese cuisine in China. Many people will be part of my business, as it will have cooks, waiters, and waitresses. These kinds of people will need to be able to cook good and authentic Chinese food. Some kind of funding we will need for example is the building, tables, kitchens, electricity lighting, and the creation of the website for takeouts.

How my business will profit is basically by buying the raw ingredients from farms and creating them into dishes that we will sell for more money. Expanding the business with getting more buildings will also expand the profit exponentially once it is created. Another way the business makes a good profit is by spending less money to start out. This way we can create more dishes from more farms to create an event bigger profit. This also why you should invest and sponsor this business; it is because of how quick this business is and how good of a start this gives us.
