Dear CMU Admissions Committee,

With each passing day, my desire to become a part of the remarkable community at CMU grows stronger. As I patiently await a decision on my waitlist status, I am compelled to reaffirm my unwavering commitment, and I would happily attend if accepted. 

Since applying to CMU, I have continued my passion for running and statistics by doing both Dragonboat and track/cross country. With the increase in the number of time trials or track meets, I have created trend graphs comparing the time of said trial with conditions such as time of day, or temperature of the surrounding area. Although a small project, it highlights my continued passion for both sports and data collection. I have also improved my overall 1600 and 3200 times from the start of the season from 6:02 to 5:44, and 13:00 to 12:49, as I continue to be dedicated towards running.

Additionally, my passion for computer programming has moved to the sector of video games, as I attempt to create bots or automated macros with the goal of better understanding game mechanics and optimizing gameplay. I have become familiar with command-line syntax like "adb devices" and "adb shell" from the Android Debug Bridge allowing me to automate processes such as launching the initial game, recording gameplay footage, and injecting custom scripts or modifications into the games I am working on. Additionally, I have explored syntax for tools like Frida, which allows me to look into running processes and monitor or alter game behavior at runtime.

Furthermore, I remain dedicated to personal growth and community involvement. I plan to continue leading and volunteering at my local church summer camp, offering my experiences to younger counselors and contributing my time and efforts to positively impact the lives of those around me. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.



dragon boat racing and track and field remains unwavering, and I recently achieved personal bests in both disciplines, showcasing my commitment to perseverance and self-improvement.
