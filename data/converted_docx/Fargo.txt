Make a brief statement or summary of your plans as they relate to your educational and career objectives and long-term goals.

I aspire to use my education in economics and business as a catalyst for transformative change in the intersection of finance and education. Financial literacy has the potential to benefit people inside and outside the world of business. I see this firsthand when my mom talks about her day at work as a forensic accountant, how she keeps people safe by doing everything from exposing fraud to auditing businesses. Ultimately, I envision using my education to bridge gaps in financial understanding, fostering a more equitable and informed society through strategic financial planning and education.

Beyond my major, I aspire to extend the transformative impact I've had on my community at Dumpling Depot to society at large. My aim is to also help small businesses thrive by reducing their reliance on expensive third-party services. My journey towards the future is a deliberate and strategic trajectory towards financial innovation, making a meaningful impact on society.
