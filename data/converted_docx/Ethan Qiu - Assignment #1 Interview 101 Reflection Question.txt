Article 1: What to Wear to Work – Tips for 4 Types of Office Dress Code Policies

	•	What are the four different types of dress code? Explain in your own words how they look. Feel free to provide examples.
The four different types of dress code in this article is business formal, business professional, business casual, and casual. Business formal is the highest formal wear as it usually includes the best formal suit (skirt suit, button suit)  and less button ups with colors that are not too bright. Hair should be formal, something that looks clean and not messy. Shoes should also not be sneakers, but should be closed toed shoes/heels that are meant for formal wear. Business professional is next on the list, and is a little more loose with everything mentioned in business formal, but with jewelry and more of an open suit. For business casual, it is even more loose, with not exactly a formal suit or dress needed. The clothing can be more colorful, can have ties, but still no sneakers. Having longer hair with even more casual accessories can be shown. For casual wear, wear casual pants but avoid jeans. Having sweaters, or polo shirts is ok. For women, they can wear normal shirts that aren’t too revealing as well as being able to wear more colorful shirts.

Video 2: Top Interview Tips

	•	When exactly does the interview start?
The interview starts the minute you walk into the building. Anyone that you run into before the interview could be asked for feedback on you. 

	•	Describe what correct posture should look like during an interview.
The posture looks like this: heads up, no slouching, and no laid back. 

	•	How should you introduce yourself? How should you greet others?
You should introduce yourself with a handshake with eye contact. Say your introduction that is authentic to you, like, “Hi, nice to meet you, Josh!” You should greet others, no matter who it is, with respect. 

	•	What is the interviewer looking for when they ask “Tell me a little about your previous experiences and what you’d bring to this role”? According to the video, how should you answer this question?
You should answer the question as honestly as possible, and think about previous past experiences that align with the role of this job and the future. Answer honestly, and if you need time, think. When talking about a previous job, do not speak about the negative, but about what you learned. 
	•	What does the video say you shouldn’t do? What should you do instead?
You should never talk about negative things about past experiences, instead talk about what you learned. Never have bad posture, instead have the best posture shown in the video. Do not do small movements with your fingers, as that can distract the interviewer from your answer or can show something else about you.

	•	How should you prepare in advance to present yourself well in front of the camera for your interview? Provide some examples.
Having good sound is the first major preparation, for example, having an empty room might have an annoying echo in your mic. Creating a good background should be the second step. For example, you should use a white wall and a few decorations that are not embarrassing in the background. It shouldn’t be anything distracting so that the interviewer focuses on you. The third step in preparation is to move your camera so as to not be too low or too high. An example is a camera that is aimed directly at your eye level and at arms length away from the computer. For the fourth step, there is good lighting. Having a lamp in front of you or having your window in front of you should make your face more bright and easier to see. Finally there is you. Sometimes makeup and changing your clothes to be more appropriate can show that you care about this interview. 

	•	Where should you look during an interview?
Look directly at the camera, not at the side or down. 

	•	What should your posture look like in front of a virtual interview?
You should have your back up head facing the camera, and no slouching. 


Article 2: Follow Up Email

	•	What are the three types of “follow-up” emails?
There is the short/long thank you emails, the checking in emails and staying in touch emails.

	•	What are the steps to write a follow-up email?
Having the subject line, of course, be appropriate in what you write for the subject, should be the main thing you are talking about. Second, show that you care with a thank you paragraph. Third, the next paragraph should be about your goals and interests. Remember to be short and concise with this part. Then after that, show that you are different by summarizing what sets you apart as a candidate; end off with “hoping to hear you” or any statement that is appropriate to close off this email. Finally, write sincerely, or thanks, etc. and your name, contacts (email, phone) on the bottom of the page to make it professional.
