Lowell Study Guide
Teachers by Subject
History/Social Studies:
	•	Worth (History): 
	•	A lot of people very strongly dislike Mr. Worth. I wouldn’t take him if you can avoid it. There’s a lot of reading. 
	•	~2 reading per week, quiz on every reading. Open notes, so take notes!
	•	Tuason
	•	He’s a pretty good teacher. His style is solidly in the lecture category and you’ll have to write pretty fast in his class. In terms of tests and quizzes, expect plenty of both. There is definitely a lot of memorization in his class, and you’ll be expected to do A LOT of reading. I mean a LOT. 
	•	For normal USH he is the chillest teacher ever, little to no reading whatsoever and minimal homework. Lets you do other homework or even geogeussur if you’re done with his work. He also has an instagram (you should follow him) 
	•	Petrini
	•	Pretty free class. I only had her for USH so I can’t speak for her AP HUG class
	•	Barely assigns homework
	•	Expect a lot of video documentaries
	•	Lots of in-class notes but again, nearly non-existent homework

English:
	•	Ms. Park (English): She’s such a sweet and understanding person! I’d definitely recommend her class, she did an excellent job preparing everyone for the AP Lit test! Test prep aside, I learned a lot about general English things in her class, which was really helpful and very interesting. The books she chooses for classes are top tier novels, and the topics covered are both interesting and difficult (in a good way). 
	•	Mr. Gaver (English): His class is really fun and he’s a great teacher! I genuinely had a fantastic time in his class and all the work made sense for the novels we were reading. He does have a very loud voice, which is a jumpscare sometimes. There are a lot of really meaningful conversations and topics covered, so the class has a lot of interesting material. Be prepared to be called out in the hallways if he spots you.
	•	Ms. Franklin (English): I didn’t love her class. I learned stuff, but it honestly wasn’t my style. There was a lot of free time, but it was unspoken. Sometimes it felt like if you didn’t agree with her she would dock you points, even if it was an interpretive assignment. She’s a nice person, but I’m not sure I would take her class again. 
	•	Ms. Galang (English): 
	•	Easily the most fun AP Lit/Euro Lit teacher if you like creative assignments. Her class is extremely project based, with assignments like “design your own utopian society” or “create propaganda supporting King Claudius(Hamlet)”. It can be quite a bit of work depending on how much effort you want to put in but a lot of it is in groups and it beats essay-writing by a mile.
	•	She does usually assign one essay per novel(about 4-5 in a year, sometimes she just asks for outlines instead of essays) as well as an AP practice unit if you’re in her AP class. I don’t know about the essay frequency in her Euro Lit classes.
	•	Be prepared to fail at every reading quiz as you struggle to remember the precise shade of yellow of Frankenstein’s monster(that’s an exaggeration, but the questions are usually pretty obscure)
	•	While the class itself isn’t too hard, she is always very particular on the kinds of answers or writing she’ll take
	•	She takes forever to grade. She procrastinates on grading like a student procrastinates on homework.

Math:
	•	T. Chan (Math):
	•	He’s both a very cool person and a great teacher! The tests are definitely difficult, but not so much that the entire class bombs them. As long as you study and pay attention in class, chances are you’ll be fine. He’s a fairly chill teacher as well and is always more than willing to help you understand the material which is great! 
	•	Yeah he's a great teacher, my sister is in his class right now so ill ask her what hes like. Apparently his geometry was pretty hard according to some other people (it is - Madison), but his calc class is amazing (except for the diagnostic test, please study on that ). Get ready for his half-sheet quizzes and also change up your handwriting to be neat and smaller because it's definitely recommended (space management is super important!!) 
	•	Bookwalter (Math): She’s a fantastic teacher and a fantastic person! The way she teaches makes things very easy to understand and I would definitely recommend taking her for AP stats! I loved being in her class and felt like I learned a lot, even though it wasn’t super excessive high pressure and high stakes. 
	•	Ambrose (Math): Banger teacher, just gives you a packet every single day to let your group complete together. All his teaching just goes into online videos, and he does check if you wrote notes for that day. This is a kind-of wingable class if you have a lot of things to do (like I did) as long as you pay attention and do the notes. 
	•	Arnold (Math): An okay algebra 2 teacher, but you won’t really learn much, unless you really self-study it yourself. The quizzes are every week but are just copy-paste homework problems. 
	•	Tran (Math): People have mixed reviews about Mr. Tran because his class is hard. It’s true that he does have a very distinct teaching style that forces you to make a lot of discoveries (it is guided). Some people say that it was too hard, but for me personally, it was a really good experience and gave my knowledge a lot of depth. In fact, I think that’s the reason calculus was easier for me - I had a good foundation in the topics which made understanding the following things much easier. I personally would definitely recommend his class!
	•	Ms. Liu (Math): Not really the greatest at teaching but her class is pretty easy. Don’t expect to learn/remember much unless you put in extra effort

	•	Mr. Sinn (Math): 
	•	I’ve never personally taken a Mr. Sinn math class, but he was my reg teacher. He’s a really nice guy and he’s always willing to help with math & advice! His classes are notorious for difficult tests and covering difficult content, but people do say they learn a lot in his class. Just be prepared to study a lot! 
	•	For his geo class (which he might not even teach anymore) please take a lot of notes and be prepared to be able to recall theorems (and apply them!!) even after weeks have passed on the old material. I had him for quarantine learning so he just allowed us to have the textbook open in front of us, but the tests were brutal. He somehow recognizes me tho cuz he follows me on instagram too (this is ethan). You might wanna avoid his precalc h class though because it made people literally cry, but only from what I’ve heard from a lot of people. 
Science:
	Computer Science:
	•	R. Chan (Computer Science): If you ever take APCSA your sophomore year, get ready to be grilled for your computer science experiences (not scratch), and he’ll have a long standing grudge if you ever decide to join and leave track(since when?). Take APCSP first before you talk to this guy, other than that if you do the homework the tests/quizzes should be simple. As long as you turn in assignments on time (and don’t ask for extensions too often) and don’t get on his bad side when he has mood swings, it would be smooth sailing. 

	Physics:
	•	Mr. Prothro (Physics): His class is very chill and very fun. His teaching style is very hands on, so be prepared to discover a lot of concepts for yourself. His tests are insanely hard, so be prepared to not do so well on them. A C would be considered good, B is really good, and A is a miracle! 
	•	Mr. Cooley (Physics): He is a great physics teacher and you will definitely learn well in his class. Just be prepared to actually learn the material, you can’t cheat your way to and A or get away with “smartly” not studying. His system is built so those who understand and try to understand succeed, which is great! His humor is an acquired taste, but a lot of people enjoy his class, myself included. He also allows you to eat in class which is AMAZING and he has a make up quiz policy which is really nice. He’s also very open to answering questions and gives a more than reasonable amount of time to complete each assignment. Tests are definitely tricky, but they test you on the material well, and are generally pretty reasonable. 
	•	Mr. Dickerman (Physics): 
	•	Disregard the following because apparently I’m in the minority for liking him. Nobody else does + he’s sexist according to others
	•	He is certainly eccentric, as you walk in his classroom and hear whatever symphony or obscure rock song he has playing on full blast and listen to him ramble on about the random tidbit of the day. However, if you get past his grumblings about common core and sometimes questionable comments, you’ll find a teacher who is genuinely committed to helping his students succeed in class and in life. 
	•	He does talk. A lot. Some may say too much(not me, but I can see what they mean). It really depends on how much you value conciseness. He has a bottomless pit of factoids about anything and everything and if you ask him a question he will not stop until he finds an answer. 
	•	Says some…questionable things
	•	He is a bit old and set in his ways, he teaches topics in AP Physics that you don’t even need because they were in the old curriculum and he thinks they’re cool.
	•	His class has a very regimented weekly schedule of lecture(M+T) -> lab(W/Th) -> quiz(F). Some harder topics he splits over two weeks but otherwise you always know what to expect and what you would miss on any given day.
	•	His weekly quizzes and tests are always multiple choice only(10 questions for quizzes ~50 for tests) and he grades the quizzes in front of you when you turn them in.
	•	He gives weekly homework packets. These are not multiple choice and will on average take 2 hours(less if you’re actually good at physics). He is however extremely lenient about due dates; he gives full credit as long as you turn it in before the end of the grading period. I would not recommend letting it pile up however because it gets really daunting really fast. It’s pretty much graded on completion though(the TAs just skim through it in my experience though that depends on who’s grading)
	•	He’s also our one and only geology teacher

	Biology:

	Chemistry:

Non-English Language:
	Chinese:
	•	Ms. Liang (Chinese): She’s such a nice person and a great teacher. I had her online, so I don’t know what her class is like in person, but I remember her being very open to helping me understand the material. I also really liked her teaching style and how much care she put into all of her classes. You’ll definitely learn a lot in her class! 

	Japanese:

	Korean:

	Spanish:

	French:

	Italian:

	Latin:

VPA (Visual performing arts):
	•	J. Chan (Choir): This Mr. Chan is the choir teacher. Sold guy with a strong attitude. He may seem very sassy on the surface level, but he’s actually a very nice guy. His sense of humor is definitely top tier and you’ll have a lot of fun in his classes! One tip I’d give is to not take advantage of his niceness and how he allows class to be more chill. Take choir seriously while having fun!

PE:
	•	Ms. Gersten: She’s a really caring PE teacher who genuinely cares about the well-being of students. I had her over zoom during my freshman year and she made me feel so welcome at Lowell even though I wasn’t actually at Lowell. 
	•	T-Ray: She’s much more harsh of a PE teacher. While she can be nice, she is also much more strict than a lot of the PE teachers, and I’d recommend staying on her good side. She is also the softball coach, though, so if you have any questions about sports you can probably ask her. 
Building Related Things
Bathrooms:
	•	Don’t use the 1st floor bathrooms unless you want to have trouble locking the doors. 
	•	2nd floor and math wing bathrooms are generally pretty small. Depending on the time, they can be really crowded and somewhat dirty. 
	•	Gender Neutral bathrooms exist! I think there’s a couple on the first floor near the nurse’s office. 
	•	World Language bathrooms are probably the nicest, but they are the most used because of that. Sometimes they’re a bit dirty. 
	•	Science wing buildings have no windows, but no one really uses them, so in my experience they’ve been pretty clean. Don’t use the ones on the second floor, those do have windows, but people use that as a reason to vape there. (If you don’t mind the smell it’s probably fine). 

Traffic:
	•	During passing period, avoid all the main building hallways. They get SUPER congested, and you’ll most likely be late to class. If possible, take the outside paths, which are much faster (especially if you need to make it across campus fast). This is of course assuming they don’t lock the outside facing doors again
	•	Park a couple blocks away from campus instead of driving right up. There’s some great 2-hour parking on ocean. You may have to walk a couple blocks to school, but it’ll save your parents a fair amount of stress!

Lunch:
	•	During the rainy season, the most popular places to eat are in the world language or the art wing. Both are good options, but I find that the World Language building can be less crowded sometimes since you have to walk outside to get there. Also, it gets really crowded basically everywhere because everyone is eating inside. 
	•	Eating on the fire lane outside the world language building is really nice. There’s plenty of seating, it’s outdoors, and there’s both shady and sunny seating! Just try not to sit under the tree too much because you might get bird-pooped on, or pine-needle-rained on if someone throws a ball into the tree. 

Practical Things 
	•	In the lunch line, DO NOT let people cut you. Box them out like your life depends on it (YES DO IT!!). Position yourself such that people cannot cut you. It’s not worth waiting half an hour extra just to be nice to the person who’s trying to cut you. The lunch line cutters DO NOT deserve your sympathy. 
	•	The library is a great place to study, but it can get a little bit loud. A lot of people go to the library just to hang out, which means that large groups can take the big tables. If there’s space in the back, it’s generally quieter there. There are also individual study spaces in the back which are great if you don’t want to be bothered. Sometimes after school they play some strange music there.
	•	You can find the school schedule on the sfusd website. 

Study Habits
	•	Write everything in your planner. And I mean everything. The title and the due date. If you always write it down, you’ll have a very low chance of forgetting to do it. I swear by having a planner and using it thoroughly, even for weekend activities.
	•	Take notes during class: you don’t even have to review the notes later(although its helpful), just the act of writing them down helps you pay attention more
	•	The Pomodoro Technique: Using study intervals can be really helpful, especially if you’re easily distracted. This is basically alternating from study to break. You can use whatever intervals you deem work best for you. There are also a lot of really helpful Pomodoro online timers!
	•	I like the tomato timer
	•	It’s also good to alternate between short and long breaks sometimes!
	•	The “Just Do It” Method (not sponsored by Nike): Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and do it. It’s hard, but once you get into the groove, just making yourself sit down and do it can be really helpful. 
	•	The 3-2-1 Method: If you’re struggling to make yourself do it, a popular method is to commit to doing it after counting down from 3. At the end of the countdown, employ the “Just Do It” Method and get up to do it. For some reason counting down can make it much easier. 
	•	If you download steam, there’s a really cute study app called Virtual Cottage. You can set timers for yourself and work in the virtual cottage! Admittedly, it’s a little pointless, but feeling like you’re doing something fun while working can make a big difference!
	•	Don’t procrastinate. It’s overrated. 
Social Things
	•	Don’t feel pressured to join a club just because all your friends are doing it or because it looks good. Clubs can be an excellent way to get out of your normal friend group and meet a lot of new people, as well as a place to get to know upperclassmen, who can guide you through your Lowell journey. Here’s a list of all the registered clubs. 
	•	Try not to get involved in other people’s drama. Let them work it out themselves rather than insert yourself into a bad situation. People will want you to take sides, and that’s not fun for you, or them. 
	•	The LSA website has a lot of really fun stuff on it, and you can usually find information about elections, clubs, sports, and other things on it.
