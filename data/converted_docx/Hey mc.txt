Hey mc  You found the secret note!! I just have a few more things to say before we never see each other again (unless you decide to go running in sf).   I really enjoyed this year (semester) with you, but I especially appreciate the time we had in 4th block *mostly studying together. I got to know more about you & how busy your schedule is– the fact that you’re a director of a summer camp, a tutor, and literally so much more – all at the same time, studying so efficiently for your other classes, like doing so much better than me in physics and calc (even tutoring me at one point) . I already kind of said this, but I looked forward to talking with you every 4th block, even if the “talking” was you locking in and studying, I still enjoyed every moment with you. I still remember the time you showed me how to share audio on airpods, and even shared your music with me – bts, taylor swift, a musical!?!-- (on an apple music subscription???) and that other time where you may have shown me how to group tabs on chrome. I really enjoyed those moments with you, and I’m glad you showed up again in my life (maybe i wouldnt have graduated w/o your help with my senioritis lol). Anyways that's enough from this letter, have fun at SLO, and when you visit, maybe we can meet up? :)
