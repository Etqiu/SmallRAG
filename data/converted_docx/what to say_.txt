If nothing else on bus ride: reminder to not say “idk” after every sentence 
Start with them: 
	•	Ask them about their orientation 
	•	>>>They talk about it
	•	Listen intently (IMPORTANT DUH)
	•	Did you find new friends? 
	•	>>> lead with your friend maybe talk about the clubs 
	•	What about your dormates, did you meet them? 
	•	Reverse, talk about my dormates, im gonna meet them tomorrow, one of them is random. 
	•	continue - yap make it interesting 
	•	Tell me more details —-
	•	Your thoughts on the buildings/classrooms (esp architecture) 
	•	Cuz i saw the engineering classrooms - classrooms
	•	What about the library when it opens? Still under construction?
	•	I guess the fanciest building i think would be like the research building near the agricultural department 
	•	Do architecture students do research as first year undergraduates? Probably not? Idk ask away think creatively 
	•	WHAT CLASSES ARE YOU TAKING BRO (what did they sign you up for) 
	•	Again reverse it back to me, maybe talk about how the system for mine works 
	•	Im still waitlisted to english, even tho its required the one i chose was a max of 20 students 
	•	I guess what did you learn most from orientation, like a main takeaway i guess 
	•	What was the day to day schedule like? 
	•	How was the food
	•	weather ? 
	•	I can tell you more about mine when i get back? We can compare haha  (add a slight smile? Idfk weirdo) 
	•	Oh do you want me to read more of your essay (s) 
	•	I thought the meal plan was kinda expensive lowkey (when i was there) 
	•	I went with my friend and i saw the pizza’s were kinda small when i was there but my friend paid for it
	•	 Maybe its because i was a non-student probably 
	•	> talk about how i'm gonna have to do that in a few days
	•	
	•	Ask them about the family event
	•	
	•	Ask them about how they feel about their summer as a whole (very broad) 
	•	Are they satisfied with what they done this summer? Maybe she asks about me? 
	•	Do you think you’ll ever run on your own as some exercise, maybe we can run again when you get back 
else: 
	Talk about ny and my coming orientation 
	•	Start by going to ny and doing my hw on the plane
	•	What is my homework ?
	•	Coding and doing the class early since all the material is online
	•	Okay cool but what about your homework is interesting???? 
	•	Well since the material is all online, i would be learning on my own, PLUS this course this semester would be part of the 21 thousand being paid 
	•	Its like computer science a, but for python 
	•	Its like mini puzzles for homework which is pretty fun 
	•	Articles and lectures for notes 
	•	NY 
	•	Show her photos to remember story – last resort possibly 
	•	First day – im in chinatown and i'm living on your street - via Madison st. 
	•	My grandparents are on this trip, which makes it kinda hard ngl 
	•	Im sleeping on an air mattress the first day cuz hotel mid
	•	Two weeks trip
	•	First day visited brooklyn bridge and it was still super humid there
	•	Basically came back with a lot of sweat since i was wearing jeans and not shorts
	•	Moral of the story is: don’t bring a backpack to ny 
	•	Few more days further - 
	•	Take the subway towards central park 
	•	RATS for the first time very cool 
	•	Subway is humid, but the subway trains have ac, super compact and also pretty hard to navigate 
	•	Subways don’t exactly have elevators so we gotta take it slow for my gramps 
	•	I also ran in the morning for ny 
	•	I don’t get how people even exercise here its insanely humid – not exactly hot 
	•	Checked out dumbo on my own 
	•	Ask her what dumbo means 
	•	“I have so many things to tell you about ny” but you love ny why not talk about your experience(s)?” – potential break to think of more
	•	Wing up the rest
