I didn’t want the rain to stop pouring
The day you came to me, 
I'm sure I’ve fallen

Soaking while I'm hoping that the rain would stop
The moment you came to me,  I’m desperately hoping 

Do you feel my heart beating? Your pictures in my head in every moment 
It seeps into my heart oh everyday  You’re a gift from a up above 
The only one I have  If the world has come to end, I will still run to you 

If a day has come just like a shower
Even if you leave me 
I’m calling your name again my love  You’re the only one I have 
 Its falling like the rain Oh please wake me up from my dream I'm lost in thoughts about you everyday

Now I’m waiting for the time  You come to me  And hold my hand so tightly  I’ll never let you go again, oh love
 You’re a gift from a up above 
The only one I have  If the world has come to end, I will still run to you 

If a day has come just like a shower
Even if you leave me 
I’m calling your name again my love  You’re the only one I have 

Let all the pain be washed away today  Washed away by raindrops falling from your face

Even in a tiring way  Even in the darkest day  Remember that I love you in every way  
You’re the only one I have  My only and only love  If the time has come, I’ll choose again,  I’ll choose you love

I will not forget all the memories  Even small, I will cherish Will engrave it to my heart You’re a gift from up above
